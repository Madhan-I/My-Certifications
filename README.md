# My-Certifications

 - It's been six years in IT field and I was like having a horse blinders where I was not having any idea on what to learn, where to learn and how to learn.
 - But, when this Corona pandemic started and with working from home, I was able to choose my aspiration path and that is Cloud
 - Well most you would think, I am just following the foot steps of many people you bet I am and I will follow and eventually one day.
 - I will have the knowlegde to work in cloud as well.

 Thanks,
 Madhan
